# Things I Struggled Through
    I had a really hard time and took a couple hours to get through figuring out how to create a new .txt for the summary data for both parts. I originally thought I could just simply touch a .txt which I was way off on and kept trouble shooting before finally turning to google and leearning how to do this correctly.
    It took me some brushing up to remember how to create a csv path but once I had it for the the PyBank it was no problem on the PyPoll.
    On the PyPoll I struggled through the append for votes and kept getting either errors or incorrect outputs because I mistakenly put 0 instead of 1. 
    
# Overall I was very frustrated at times but one thing this class is teaching me is that the longer moments of frustration become totally worth it when I have the short eureka moments when everything finally clicks.

# I also waited until I was finished with the assingment to create the repository. I know how to start a repository from a couples weeks ago in class. But uploading the information was a challenge and I could have saved myself about an hours worth of a headache trying to figure it out as well as the posibility of losing all my work which I didnt realize was a possibility because I had only glanced over the last part of the hints and considerations.
